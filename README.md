# TFG

Must fix an issue when extracting data from fotocasa as the number of companies retrieved may not be the same as the houses, throwing an index error.

When that is fixed, must store the data as json for the servers/clients to load it and do more tests. Mongo is now working.

After that is working, must retrieve zone information from fotocasa, linking the zones with the houses. 

When that is done, create a settings file with parameters such as interest rates to calculate mortgages and rentabilities.

Add compatibility to the server functions to the processing part of the app.

If idealista doesn't provide us an API we'll have to take our own actions.

When all the data is ready and the server is responding, the website must be designed.
