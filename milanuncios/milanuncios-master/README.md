This is a parser of information from the site https://www.milanuncios.com about 
the number of apartments in the cities of Malaga and Torremolinos, depending on 
the price. The data is written to an excel file Estadistica.xlsm. The site 
issues only 10 requests, then blocks the parser. The script only works with 
Spanish IP. When using VPN, not all IPs have access to the site.
